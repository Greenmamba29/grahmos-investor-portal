## 📊 Current System Architecture

### Authentication Flow (Notion-Based)
```
User Signup → Notion API (Create User) → JWT Token Generation → 
HTTP-Only Cookie → Session Management → Role-Based Access Control
```

### Database Schema (Notion)
```typescript
interface NotionUser {
  id: string;              // Notion page ID (auto-generated)
  email: string;           // User's email (unique identifier)
  firstName?: string;      // User's first name
  lastName?: string;       // User's last name
  password?: string;       // Bcrypt hashed password (12 rounds)
  role?: string;          // pending | standard | investor | admin
  userType?: string;      // user | waitlist | investor | admin
  createdAt?: string;     // ISO date string
}
```

### Technology Stack
**Frontend:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite (build tool with SWC)
- React Router for routing
- shadcn/ui + Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS with dark mode
- React Query for state management

**Backend:**
- Netlify Functions (serverless)
- Notion API v5.3.0
- JWT with bcrypt
- Email notifications via SendGrid

**Infrastructure:**
- Netlify hosting & CI/CD
- Notion database
- Environment variable validation
- Error boundaries

### Routing Architecture
**Public Routes (10):**
- `/`, `/overview`, `/market`, `/product`, `/competitive`, `/financial`, `/team`, `/auth`, `/investor-relations`, `/auth/reset-password`

**Protected Routes (7):**
- `/dashboard` (authenticated)
- `/investor/apply` (authenticated)
- `/investor-portal` (investor/admin only)
- `/admin` (admin only)
- `/admin/dashboard` (admin only)
- `/admin/requests` (admin only)

### User Role Hierarchy
```
pending → standard → investor
                  ↘
                   admin (elevated access)
```
