# Email Notifications System - FIXED ✅

## 🚨 Critical Issues Fixed

The email notification system has been completely fixed to resolve the critical authentication flow issues:

### Issues That Were Fixed:

1. **❌ User signup emails not being sent** → ✅ **FIXED**
2. **❌ Admin notifications not being sent on user signups** → ✅ **FIXED** 
3. **❌ Admin notifications not being sent on application submissions** → ✅ **FIXED**
4. **❌ User notifications not being sent on application approvals/denials** → ✅ **FIXED**
5. **❌ Email service was only logging to console** → ✅ **FIXED with SendGrid integration**

## 📧 Email Types Implemented

### User Emails
- **Welcome Email**: Sent when users sign up
- **Investor Approval Email**: Sent when admin approves investor application
- **Investor Rejection Email**: Sent when admin denies investor application

### Admin Emails
- **New User Signup Alert**: Sent to all admins when new users register
- **New Application Alert**: Sent to all admins when investor applications are submitted
- **Decision Confirmation**: Sent to admins when they approve/deny applications

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# Email Service (SendGrid recommended)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@grahmos.info

# Admin Configuration
ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@grahmos.info,support@grahmos.info

# Alternative Webhook Service
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-service.com/send-email
WEBHOOK_TOKEN=your_webhook_token
```

### Email Service Priority

1. **SendGrid** (if `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is configured)
2. **Webhook Service** (if `WEBHOOK_URL` is configured)
3. **Console Logging** (fallback for development)
