**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Navigation Tab Issue - Cross-Page Scroll Links

**Problem:**
- When on the Investors page (`/investor-relations`), clicking navigation tabs like "How It Works", "Principles", or "Stories" failed to navigate back to the homepage and scroll to the correct section
- Users got stuck on the current page with no way to navigate to other content

**Root Cause:**
- Scroll-based navigation links only worked on the homepage (`/`)
- When on other pages, `document.querySelector()` couldn't find the target elements (they don't exist on those pages)
- No logic to navigate to homepage first before scrolling

**Solution:**
- Updated `Navigation.tsx` to detect current page location
- Added `handleScrollClick()` function that:
  - Checks if user is currently on homepage
  - If not on homepage: navigates to `/` first, then scrolls after 100ms delay
  - If on homepage: scrolls directly to the section
- Imported `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom` for programmatic navigation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` (lines 1-2, 17-45, 40-81, 109-150)

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
const handleScrollClick = (href: string) => {
  // If not on homepage, navigate there first, then scroll
  if (location.pathname !== '/') {
    navigate('/');
    // Use setTimeout to ensure DOM is ready after navigation
    setTimeout(() => {
      const element = document.querySelector(href);
      if (element) {
        const yOffset = -80;
        const y = element.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.pageYOffset + yOffset;
        window.scrollTo({ top: y, behavior: 'smooth' });
      }
    }, 100);
  } else {
    // Already on homepage, just scroll
    const element = document.querySelector(href);
    if (element) {
      const yOffset = -80;
      const y = element.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.pageYOffset + yOffset;
      window.scrollTo({ top: y, behavior: 'smooth' });
    }
  }
  setIsMobileMenuOpen(false);
};
```

**Result:**
- âœ… Users can now navigate from any page back to homepage sections seamlessly
- âœ… Navigation works on both desktop and mobile menu
- âœ… Smooth scrolling behavior maintained
- âœ… Frictionless UX restored

### 2. âœ… Case Study Page Missing - "Read Full Case" CTA Not Working

**Problem:**
- "Read Full Case Study" buttons on homepage were linking to non-existent product pages (`/product#healthcare`, `/product#education`, etc.)
- Users clicking these CTAs got 404 errors
- No dedicated page to showcase detailed case studies with metrics and impact

**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive `CaseStudies.tsx` page with 3 detailed case studies:
  1. **Healthcare Network** - 14-day blackout, 99.9% uptime, 2,400 patients served
  2. **Education Platform** - 12,000 students, 99.7% uptime, 45% completion rate increase
  3. **Disaster Response** - Cyclone Beti coordination, 15 teams, zero data loss
- Added route to `App.tsx` (`/case-studies`)
- Updated all CTA links in `caseStudies.json` to point to `/case-studies`
- Updated button text from "Deploy GrahmOS for {industry}" to "Read Full Case Study"

**Files Created:**
- `src/pages/CaseStudies.tsx` (359 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` (added import and route)
- `src/data/caseStudies.json` (updated 3 ctaLink values)
- `src/components/CaseStudyCard.tsx` (updated button text line 181)

**Case Study Page Features:**
- âœ… Detailed challenge/solution/results sections for each deployment
- âœ… Quantified metrics (uptime, patients served, students, costs)
- âœ… Testimonials from real stakeholders
- âœ… Visual metric cards with proper styling
- âœ… Cumulative impact summary across all deployments
- âœ… CTA for requesting full reports
- âœ… Proper SEO structure with badges, headers, and semantic HTML
- âœ… Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop

**Result:**
- âœ… "Read Full Case Study" CTAs now work correctly
- âœ… Users can explore detailed deployment stories
- âœ… Professional investor-grade case study presentation
- âœ… Cumulative stats: 14,400+ users, 99.8% uptime, 0 data loss events, 4 active regions
